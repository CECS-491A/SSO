## GitHub Flow
### For creating a branch
A new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive, for example:
feature/user-registration
chore/refactor-db

### Commits
Write clear commit messages so you can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.

### Pull Requests (PR's)
Pull Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the master branch.

### Code Reviews
Once a PR is opened, someone else mush view your code in order for a PR to become approved for merge. 

### Merge
Once a PR is approved, then the branch can be merged into master.
